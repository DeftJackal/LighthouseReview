Summary of Lighthouse Labs Data Sets

This will be an archive of refactored and cleaned up code from Lighthouse Labs Data Science course. The material is sorted by Week and Day with a summary readme for each day.

This archive will be updated in non chronological order depending on personal studies. If you want to see a specific type of project updated, please contact me at jameslloyd@rocketmail.com.

A table of contents will be produced closer to completion of this archive.
