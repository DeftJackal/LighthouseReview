Thoughts and comments on reviewing my presentation.

1) Poor titling an description on title page. Color palette is not great. 
2) Very Text heavy slides. I should have found a way to have image based slides not text based. 
3) Like how the prcess is shown as test cases in slide 8. 
4) Presentation was likely long and over the 5 minute time limit. 
5) Would have liked the process explained more.
